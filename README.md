=========
Simple to use library that allows for complex image construction.

## Motivation
Although there are quite a few image libraries, none of them handle image construction in a way that is "tidy". The most obvious issue is it is essentially impossible to create areas within an image. This library will attempt to alleviate these issues and many others.

## Caveat
This library has no desire for speed.

While this library is beneath ver 1.0+, breaking changes will be undocumented and should be expected.

## Installing
```
python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/SilicalNZ/canvas
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
